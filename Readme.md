# Solving Sudoku

In this project I use python to solve any given sudoku puzzle. <br/>

Sudoku puzzles are given in a string where a number represents a starter value and '.' represents an empty box that needs to be solved. <br/>

I then demonstrate how a simple puzzle can be solved using constraint propagation. <br/>

Finally I demonstrate how when given a harder puzzle a combination of constraint propagation and depth first search is needed to create a solution that can solve any puzzle given.
